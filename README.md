# Continuous Integration Server

Implements a small continuous integration (CI) server that supports compilation of commits, execution of automated tests and notification of CI results.

## Description

This project focuses on implementing a continuous integration (CI) server that supports three main features: compilation, automated test execution and notification. More specifically, the CI server should be able to compile the commits that were pushed to the server as well as execute any automated tests. Furthermore, the CI server should notify the client of the results by a commit status; possible check statuses are *passing*, *pending* or *failing*. More information on the implementation of these features and how they were tested are covered in the sections below.

The aim of this project is to master the core of continuous integration by implementing a small CI server, which was an assignment given by the course DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals.

Currently, these are the language(s) that the CI server can compile:

* [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)

Currently, these are the testing framework(s) that the CI server can execute:

* [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/)

### Configuration

The repo that uses the CI service should contain a file named `ci-config.json` in the root directory. The file provides the necessary information about the project to the CI-server. The stated language of the project is used to select the correct set of commands run by the CI-server when compiling and running tests. It should also specify where the source and test code of the project is located relative to the root directory. Below is an example of a correctly formed `ci-config.json` file.

```
{
  "language": "java",
  "path": {
    "src": "src",
    "test": "test"
  }
}
```

### Compilation

When the CI-server recieves a POST request information about the GitHub repository responsible for the request is extracted. The server clones the repository, checks out the relevant branch, and looks for source files in the path specified in `ci-config.json`. The compile commands for the specified language is run, if there are any errors the CI-server sends a response with status `202` and information about what went wrong. The errors are detected by checking if standard error was written to.

Unit tests for the compilation function at the CI-server include tests for compiling:

* Correctly formed source files
* Incorrecly formed source files
* Correctly formed test files
* Incorrectly formed test files
* No files

### Test Execution

Similarly to the compilation feature, the CI-server will recieve a POST request sent from GitHub. This will prompt the server to clone the repository and check out to the branch in interest. It will then proceed to extract the test files specified in the `ci-config.json` and execute the compile commands for the specified language. If the CI-server finds an error, it will send a status response of `202` with the `message` specifying that it is a `test` error. 

Unit tests for the test execution feature include testing for:

* Incorrectly formed test files
* Correctly formed test files
* Correctly formed test files but failing compilation 
* Incorrectly formed test files with passing compilation

### Notification

Upon recieving a POST-request sent from GitHub the CI-server sends `status pending`, making the build status on GitHub show as pending. Depending on if the CI-server detected any problems within the project either `status success` or `status failure` will be sent to GitHub. GitHub will update the build status and show the appropriate symbol at the corresponding commit. If an unexpected error occurs at the server `status error` will be sent to GitHub.


## Getting Started
Please follow the install guides to set up the environment for this system:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)

Note that a GitHub account is required for the next steps; how to create an account can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/). Once an account has been set up, the user will be able to get a working copy of the existing Git repository with the following commands:

for Linux:

```shell
$ cd /home/user/my_project
```

for Windows:

```shell
$ cd /c/user/my_project
```

for macOS:

```shell
$ cd /Users/user/my_project
```

and type:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/gustafguner/fundamentals-lab2.git
```

There should now be a working copy of the repository available on your local machine.

### Running Tests

To run the automated tests of the system:
`yarn test`

### Prerequisites
* Node.js version 10.0.0 or greater
* NPM version 5.6.0
* Yarn version 1.13.0
* TypeScript version 3.3.1 or greater

See section [Built With](#built-with) for more details on the tools.

## How to Run
The following sections describe how to set up the development environment and how tests on the system can be run.

### Set up
To be able to start developing, the environment needs to be set up with a working copy of the CI-server available on the local machine (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)).

#### Gain access to Github account
To allow the CI-server to gain access to your GitHub account a `Personal Access` token must be generated. Please follow these steps to do so:

1. Log in to your GitHub account

2. Go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens

3. Click `Generate new token`

4. Write a token description and check the `repo:status` box

5. Click generate token and copy the generated token

On the root repository of the CI-server there is a file named `.env` in which the `GITHUB_TOKEN` (the generated token) should be saved in the following format:

```shell
GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-goes-here"
```

#### Set up database connection
Create a mongoDB database using [mLab](https://mlab.com/).  Go to `https://mlab.com/databases/<name-of-database>` and copy the mongoDB URI shown at the top of the page. Click on `Users > Add database user` and create a user and password for the database. Edit the `.env` file to include:

```shell
MONGODB_URL=<url>
MONGODB_USERNAME=<user>
MONGODB_PASSWORD=<password>
```
where `url` is the URI without `<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@`. E.g. `"mongodb://ds055935.mlab.com:55935/example-database"`.

#### Monitor server changes
To start monitoring changes to the CI-server, please do the following steps:

1. Go into the CI server directory and start to monitor the changes with the following commands:

```shell
$ yarn
$ yarn watch
```
You should get something like this:

![yarn](https://github.com/gustafguner/fundamentals-lab2/blob/master/yarn-example.png)

2. Create or go into a (test) repository to run the CI-server on and type the following command.

```shell
$ ngrok http 3000
```

You should then see something like this:

![ngrok](https://github.com/gustafguner/fundamentals-lab2/blob/master/ngrok-example.png)

Note that the compilation and test execution on the CI-server only works for certain languages and frameworks. See [Description](#description) for more information.

3. Copy the URL (it should end with `.io`, e.g. `https://56b3bb3f.ngrok.io`) and go into the test repository in GitHub.

4. Click on `Settings` > `Webhooks` > `Add webhook`

5. Paste the copied URL in `Payload URL` appended with `/ci` (e.g. `https://56b3bb3f.ngrok.io/ci`).

6. In `Content type` choose `application/json`.

7. Finish by clicking on the `Add webhook` button.

If everything is working correctly then whenever a commit is pushed to the test repository in GitHub, the CI-server should be able to compile the code, execute tests and notify the developer of the results.
